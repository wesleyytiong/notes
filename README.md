# NIST 800-37 Rev. 2 RMF (Risk Management Framework)
* Risk avoidance -> reduce (mitigate) -> transfer -> accept
* What level of risk is acceptable for a system? 
* When to use? Protect sensitive information, develop/implement new system, after security breach, making changes to system
1) Prepare - upfront planning
* Align RMF process with organizational objectives/risk management strategy 
2) Categorize the System
* Think: What type of data? Credit cards -> PCI DSS, PHI -> HIPAA, etc.
* How does the information system impact the system? CIA Triad (low, moderate, high) 
* NIST 800-60 - help determine appropriate security categorization of information and information systems
3) Select security controls
* Pick out controls from NIST 800-53 control families
4) Implement Security Controls
* Can take a long time, control implementations should not cripple required functionality
5) Assess Security Controls
* Security Assessor/Auditor
* Is the security controls implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing desired outcome?
6) Authorize the System
* AO (Authorizing Official) signs off/formally documents and accept remaining risk within the system
7) Monitor the Controls/System
* New vulnerabilities/threats on the system? remediate/respond to them
* Changes to system signed off by AO ideally do not increase risk
