## 1.0 Networking Concepts
### 1.1 Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection
(OSI) reference model - Open Systems Interconnection 
All People Seem To Need Data Processing
• Layer 1 - Physical - Electrical signals - Signaling, cabling, connectors
• Layer 2 - Data link - "switching" layer - Ethernet, DLC (Data Link Control) - MAC (Media Access Control)
• Layer 3 - Network - "routing" layer - IP Encapsulation 
• Layer 4 - Transport - "post office" layer - TCP/UDP - TCP Encapsulation
• Layer 5 - Session - Communication management between devices (start/stop/restart) - control protocols, tunneling protocols, link the presentation to the transport
• Layer 6 - Presentation - Character encoding (SSL/TLS) - application encryption (often combined with Application layer)
• Layer 7 - Application - The layer we see (HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3) - https://mail.google.com
### 1.2 Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions.
• Physical and virtual appliances
- Router - OSI layer 3 - routes traffic between IP subnets, routers inside of switches sometimes called "layer 3 switches"
- Switch - OSI layer 2 - bridging done in hardware (ASIC - Application specific integrated circuit) - forwards traffic based on data link address
- Firewall - Traditional vs NGFW (Layer 3 devices (router)) - filter traffic by port number or application, encrypts traffic (VPN between sites), NAT (network access translation), dynamic routing
- Intrusion detection system
(IDS)/intrusion prevention 
system (IPS) - Watch network traffic (alert buffer overflows, XSS, etc)
- Load balancer - distribute the load (multiple servers), fault tolerance (server outages have no effect, fast convergence), TCP offload (protocol overhead), SSL/TCP offload (encryption/decryption), caching (fast response), prioritization (QoS), content switching (application-centric balancing)
- Proxy - Sits between users and external network, receives user requests and sends request on their behalf - useful for caching information, access control, URL filtering, content scanning
- Network-attached storage (NAS) - Connect shared storage device across network, file-level access
- Storage area network (SAN) - Block-level access, very efficient reading and writing, looks and feels like a local storage device
- Wireless
o Access point (AP) - Layer 2 device, a bridge - extends wired network onto wireless network, not a wireless router (wireless router is a router + access point in single device) 
o Controller - centralized management of access points 
• Applications
- Content delivery network (CDN) - speed up process of time to get data from one place to another (geographically distributed caching servers - duplicate data, users gets data from local server)
• Functions
- Virtual private network (VPN) - secure private data traversing public network (encrypted communication on insecure medium) Concentrator/head-end encryption/decryption access device (often integrated into firewall) - many deployment options (specialized cryptographic hardware/sofware-based options available)
- Quality of service (QoS) - traffic shaping, packet shaping, control bandwitch usage/data rates - set important applications to havve higher priorities than other apps
- Time to live (TTL) - how long should data be available? Tell system when to stop -USES: drop packet caught in a loop, clear a cache - TTL macOS/Linux is 64 hops, TTL Windows is 128 hops
### 1.3 Summarize cloud concepts and connectivity options.
• Network functions virtualization (NFV) - replace physical network devices with virtual versions - manage from hypervisor 
• Virtual private cloud (VPC) - pool of resources created in a public cloud - connected with transit gateway ("cloud router")
• Network security groups - assign security rule to specific VNIC - more granularity/control - firewall for the cloud (control inbound/outbound traffic flows) 
• Network security lists - assign security rule to an entire IP subnet (very broad)
• Cloud gateways 
- Internet gateway - connects users on the internet
- Network address translation (NAT) gateway - private cloud subnets connect to external resources (external)
• Cloud connectivity options
- VPN - site-to-site VPN through the internet
- Direct Connect - VPC Endpoint (between cloud provider networks)
• Deployment models
- Public - available to everyone over the internet
- Private - virtualized local data center
- Hybrid - mix of public and private
• Service models
- Software as a service (SaaS) - on-demand software (no local installation) - centralized management of data and applications, a complete application offering
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - sometimes called HaaS (hardware as a service) outsource equipment (you're responsible for management and security) - data still out there but within your control
- Platform as a service (PaaS) - no servers, no software, no maintenance team - someone handles platform, you handle development - dont need to control data, people, or infrastructure (put the building blocks together, example: Salesforce) 
• Scalability
• Elasticity
• Multitenancy

## Network Impelementation

### 2.1 Explain characteristics of routing technologies.
• Static routing - administratively define the routes (easy to configure and manage smaller networks, no overhead, easy to configure on stub networks (only one way out), more secure) No automatic routing
• Dynamic routing - routers send routes to other routers - no manual route calculations or management, populated automatically, very scalable (some router overhead, requires initial config to work properly)
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - exterior gateway protocol, connected different AS - three-napkins protocol, popular standard
- Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) - Cisco centric relatively easy to enable to use
- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) - common interior gateway protocol (used within single autonomous system (AS)) well-established standard, link-state protocol - routing based on connectivity between routers. Low cost and fastest path wins, identical costs are load balanced
• Route selection
- Administrative distance - two routing protocols, two completely different metric calculations (lower -> better)
- Prefix length - most specific route "wins" - combination of subnet ID and prefix length
- Metric - each routing protocol has its own way of calculating best route
• Address translation
- NAT - network address translation -> public vs private IP address
- Port address translation (PAT) - NAT overload (translating IP and port number)
• First Hop Redundancy Protocol
(FHRP) - computer configured with single default gateway 
• Virtual IP (VIP) - for default gateway (if router disappears, another one takes its place -> data continues to flow)
• Subinterfaces - device has physical interface, configure options for each interface -> (some interfaces are not physical -> subinterfaces)
### 2.2 Given a scenario, configure switching technologies and features.
• Virtual Local Area Network
(VLAN) - gruop of devices in same broadcast domain (separated logically instead of physically)
- VLAN database
- Switch Virtual Interface (SVI) - layer 3 switches
• Interface configuration
- Native VLAN
- Voice VLAN
- 802.1Q tagging - connecting VLAN between switches
- Link aggregation - port bonding (aka LAG) - multiple interfaces act like one big interface
- Speed - set auto, if manual -> set the same (how fast) 10/100/1000/ 10 gig
- Duplex - half/full
• Spanning tree - STP 802.1D - blocking (not forwarding to prevent a loop), listening (not forwarding and cleaning MAC table), learning (not forwarding and adding to MAC table), forwarding (data passes through), disabled RSTP (802.1w) -latest standard
• Maximum transmission unit (MTU) - maximum IP packet to transmit but not fragment -> fragmentation slows things down
- Jumbo frames - ethernet frames that are more than 1.5k bytes (can increase to 9k) more efficient
### 2.3 Given a scenario, select and configure wireless devices and technologies.
• Channels - groups of frequencies 
- Channel width
- Non-overlapping channels
- Regulatory impacts
o 802.11h - DFS (dynamic frequency selection) - avoid freq conflict, access point can switch to unused frequency, TPC (transmit power control) avoid conflict w/satellite services, access point determiners power output of the client
• Frequency options
- 2.4GHz
- 5GHz
- 6GHz
- Band steering - many frequencies to choose from -> directs clients to best frequency
• Service set identifier (SSID) - name of wireless network
- Basic service set identifier
(BSSID) - hardware address of an access point (MAC)
- Extended service set identifier
(ESSID)
• Network types
- Mesh networks - multiple access points
- Ad hoc - uses 802.11 to directly communicate between 2 devices, IBSS (independent basic service set) - no access point required (USES: IoT Devices)
- Point to point - two access points together (building to building, site to site) extends wired network over a distance
- Infrastructure - clients communicate to an access point
• Encryption
- Wi-Fi Protected Access 2
(WPA2) - CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol) or CBC-MAC Protocol. AES Encryption and MIC (message integrity check)
- WPA3 - uses Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) instead of CBC-MAC
• Guest networks
- Captive portals - authentication to network -> access table recognizes
• Authentication
- Pre-shared key (PSK) vs. Enterprise 
• Antennas
- Omnidirectional vs. directional - directional focuses in one direction (e.g. yagi or parabolic antenna)
• Autonomous vs. lightweight
access point - lightweight is in switch (less expensive)

### 2.4 Explain important factors of physical installations.
• Important installation implications
- Locations
o Intermediate distribution
 frame (IDF) - extension of MDF
o Main distribution frame (MDF) - central point of the network (usually data center)
- Rack size - 19" rack/device width, Height is 1U or 1.75"
- Port-side exhaust/intake
- Cabling 
o Patch panel
o Fiber distribution panel - patch panel at both ends 
- Lockable 
• Power

(UPS)
- Power distribution unit (PDU) -provide multiple power outlets
- Power load
- Voltage
• Environmental factors
- Humidity - high humidity (condensation) low humidity (static discharge) - ideally 40-60% 
- Fire suppression - dont use water, tanks w/chem agent and dispersed
