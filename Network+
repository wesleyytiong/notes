## 1.0 Networking Concepts
### 1.1 Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection
(OSI) reference model.
All People Seem To Need Data Processing
• Layer 1 - Physical - Cables, fiber, and the signal itself
• Layer 2 - Data link - DLC (MAC - Media Access Control) address, EUI (Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-48,64), Switch)
• Layer 3 - Network - Routing layer (IP - Internet Protocol), Router, Packet
• Layer 4 - Transport - TCP/UDP
• Layer 5 - Session - Communication management between devices (start/stop/restart)
• Layer 6 - Presentation - Character encoding (SSL/TLS)
• Layer 7 - Application - Your eyes
### 1.2 Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications,
and functions.
• Physical and virtual appliances
- Router - OSI layer 3
- Switch - OSI layer 2 
- Firewall - Traditional vs NGFW (Layer 3 devices (router)) - NAT, Dynamic Routing
- Intrusion detection system
(IDS)/intrusion prevention
system (IPS) - Watch network traffic (alert buffer overflows, XSS, etc)
- Load balancer - fault tolerance, caching, SSL/TCP offload
- Proxy - Receives user requests and sends request on their behalf - useful for caching information, access control, URL filtering, content scanning
- Network-attached storage (NAS) - File-level access
- Storage area network (SAN) - Very efficient reading and writing (block-level access)
- Wireless
o Access point (AP) - Layer 2 router and access point in single device
o Controller - centralized management of access points 
• Applications
- Content delivery network (CDN) - speed up process off time to get data from one place to another (geographically distributed caching servers)
• Functions
- Virtual private network (VPN) - secure private data traversing public network. Concentrator/head-end - encryption/decryption access device
- Quality of service (QoS) - traffic shaping, packet shaping, control bandwitch usage/data rates
- Time to live (TTL) - how long should data be available? Tell system when to stop
### 1.3 Summarize cloud concepts and connectivity options.
• Network functions virtualization
(NFV) - replace physical network devices with virtual versions
• Virtual private cloud (VPC) - pool of resources created in a public cloud - connected with transit gateway
• Network security groups - assign security rule to specific VNIC - more granularity/control
• Network security lists - assign security rule to an entire IP subnet (very broad)
• Cloud gateways
- Internet gateway
- Network address translation
(NAT) gateway
• Cloud connectivity options
- VPN
- Direct Connect
• Deployment models
- Public
- Private
- Hybrid
• Service models
- Software as a service (SaaS) - on-demand software (no local installation) - centralized management of data and applications
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - outsource equipment (you're responsible for management and security)
- Platform as a service (PaaS) - no servers, no software, no maintenance team - someone handles platform, you handle development 
• Scalability
• Elasticity
• Multitenancy

### 1.4 Explain common networking ports, protocols, services,
and traffic types.
Protocols/Ports
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 20/21 - (active/control) Transfer files between systems
Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) 22  
Secure Shell (SSH) 22 - encrypted communication link
Telnet 23 - in-the-clear communication
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 25 - server to server email transfer
Domain Name System (DNS) 53 - FQDN - converts names to IP address
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 67/68 - automated configuration of IP address, subnet mask, and other options, is lease, but can do DHCP reserve
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) 69 - small bit of info
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 80 - communication in the browser
Network Time Protocol (NTP) 123 - stay synced clocks -log files, authentication information, outage details
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 161/162 - v1-3 - gather statistics from network devices - SNMP traps alerts and notifications 
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 389 - store and retrieve information in network directory
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) 443
Server Message Block (SMB) 445 - WINDOWS file sharing, printer sharing etc (CIFS - common internet file system) 
Syslog 514 - message logging (used with central log collector - SIEM)
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure (SMTPS) 587
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over SSL (LDAPS) 636
Structured Query Language (SQL) Server 1433
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 3389
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 5060/5061
